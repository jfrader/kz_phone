# KZ PHONE

## A FiveM based Phone

This is an AGPL project that intends to be a Phone Addon for FiveM and GTA V.

## Idea behind

I had this idea originally inspired by [gcphone](https://github.com/N3MTV/gcphone) and the willing
to make a brand new addon for FiveM that would make use of some 
of the newest technologies that I love, such as ReactJS.

The base project was created under [Re-Ignited-Development](https://github.com/Re-Ignited-Development/)
with the help of Chip, Rocko and BtnGaming as they as well have had the same idea of making a new phone using react.

After one week, I decided to open myself from the team as I have had a couple of bad moments and discussions with one of the members.

I now reupload the code I (J Francisco Rader or Kidz) have written, removing the other files that I have not written.
